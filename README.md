# College: Digital Lock using Verilog HDL

We designed a keyless electronic door lock, which is based on the principles of sequence detectors using D - flip flops, and to implement it in the FPGA board. The primary objective of the project was to produce a VHDL design which can be programmed on Altera DE2 board. This project gives an overview of how different components of DE2 board can be interfaced as we are using various parts like switches, LEDs, push Buttons, 7-segment display, etc. and information on how to assign these physically interactive inputs and visual outputs to the VHDL code designed in Quartus Software.
